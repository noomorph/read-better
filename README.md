read-better
===========

**read-better** is just a few CSS rules that make unformatted HTML document easier to read on mobile and desktop devices.

To use it, embed the following two lines:

```html
<head>
...
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /> <!-- required for mobile devices -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/read-better.css"> <!-- your path to css -->
...
</head>
```

Any suggestions? You are welcome.
